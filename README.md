Highlightr is an iOS & macOS syntax highlighter built with Swift. It uses [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) as it core, supports [185 languages and comes with 89 styles](https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/).

Takes your lame string with code and returns a NSAttributtedString with proper syntax highlighting.

## Installation
### Requirements
- iOS 8.0+
- macOS 10.10+
 
### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate Highlightr into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod 'Highlightr'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate Highlightr into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "raspu/Highlightr"
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `Highlightr.framework` into your Xcode project.Highlightr

## Usage
Highlightr provides two main classes:

### Highlightr
This is the main endpoint, you can use it to convert code strings into NSAttributed strings.
```Swift
let highlightr = Highlightr()
highlightr.setTheme(to: "paraiso-dark")
let code = "let a = 1"

// You can omit the second parameter to use automatic language detection.
let highlightedCode = highlightr.highlight(code, as: "swift") 
```
### CodeAttributedString
A subclass of NSTextStorage, you can use it to highlight text on real time.
```Swift
let textStorage = CodeAttributedString()
textStorage.language = "Swift"
let layoutManager = NSLayoutManager()
textStorage.addLayoutManager(layoutManager)

let textContainer = NSTextContainer(size: view.bounds.size)
layoutManager.addTextContainer(textContainer)

let textView = UITextView(frame: yourFrame, textContainer: textContainer)
```

## JavaScript?

Yes, Highlightr relies on iOS & macOS [JavaScriptCore](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Carbon/Reference/WebKit_JavaScriptCore_Ref/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004754) to parse the code using highlight.js. This is actually quite fast!

## Performance

It will never be as fast as a native solution, but it's fast enough to be used on a real time editor.

It comes with a custom made HTML parser for creating NSAttributtedStrings, is pre-processing the themes and is preloading the JS libraries. As result it's taking around of 50 ms on my iPhone 6s for processing 500 lines of code.
